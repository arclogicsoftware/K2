# K2

## WARNING -> THIS IS BETA BUT IT WORKS

K2 is in **development**. While it is stable at any point in time, I will be making changes over the course of 2022 and have no plans to always ensure a seamless upgrade path. I can only say at the end of the year if all goes well, K2 will be stable and maybe pretty awesome.

## ABOUT

> "It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you." - George Bell

Ready to start a software development adventure with Oracle APEX? K2 would like to help guide you there.

Why K2? [K2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2) is thought to be the most difficult mountain in the world to summit. Few have done it. 91 have died trying. To make an analogy (in a very small way), building a SAAS company is also notoriously difficult and most fail.

The goal of K2 is to give you the tools and the strategies to help you survive the journey. Keep reading to start your adventure.

## SETUP/INSTALL

> “Scott Adams famously said, Set up systems, not goals. Use your judgment to figure out what kinds of environments you can thrive in, and then create an environment around you so you’re statistically likely to succeed.” - Naval Ravikant

### Prerequisites

**Required**

* Access to an Oracle APEX workspace.
* 'admin' level database privs.

**Recommended**

* Some experience with Git
* SQL & PL/SQL experience
* SQL Developer
* SublimeText or other code editor (above works also)
* Dropbox or other file sync solution
* Git GUI
* GitBash or other bash shell if you are on Windows
* WinMerge or other file compare utility
* Markdown experience
* GhostWriter
* Plenty of patience

### Install

* Create Oracle database accounts.
	- Create the main account used to log into the workspace. I created a user called "APP". This can be used for multiple applications. 
	- Create a user for each app environment. I created "SLDEV" for my superloser.io DEV environment and "SLPRD" for the production environment.
		+ WARNING: I don't really recommend hosting dev and production in the same database but we are doing it here to keep thing as simple as possible.
	- 

### Grant permissions to new accounts Arcsql will need to function properly.

### Run the K2 install script for each account.


* Installation
* Email configuration and testing.
* Set log level.
* Walk through any remaining configuration options.
